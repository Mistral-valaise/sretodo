# Progress: Observability MVP Demo App

## 1. Current Status

-   **Overall:** Project initialized, basic service structures created, initial Docker Compose setup and observability configs added. All changes pushed to GitHub.
-   **Focus:** Creating Dockerfiles for each service.
-   **Date:** $(date +%Y-%m-%d)

## 2. What Works

-   Project directory structure exists.
-   Basic project files for each service language/framework are present (`pom.xml`, `.csproj`, `package.json`, `go.mod`, `requirements.txt`).
-   `docker-compose.yml` defines all required services and observability components.
-   Configuration files for Prometheus, Otel Collector, and Tempo exist.
-   Code committed and pushed to `feature-250404-start` branch.

## 3. What's Left to Build (High-Level MVP Goals)

1.  **Dockerfiles:** Create Dockerfiles for all services.
2.  **Docker Compose Build/Up:** Verify that all service images can be built and containers start.
3.  **Basic Service Logic:** Implement core functionality (ToDo CRUD, Pomodoro Timers, Statistik Aggregation, Health Checks, Frontend Display).
4.  **OpenTelemetry Integration:** Configure and verify telemetry data flow from all services to the Collector and backends.
5.  **Grafana Dashboards:** Create basic dashboards for visualizing data.

## 4. Known Issues / Challenges
