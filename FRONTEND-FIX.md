# Frontend and Backend Service Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Frontend Deployment**
   - Updated from dynamic Angular frontend to static HTML content due to GitHub Container Registry access issues
   - Created a ConfigMap to provide static content
   - Fixed frontend pod to mount the ConfigMap

2. **API Path Corrections**
   - Fixed NGINX gateway configuration to properly route API requests:
     - Updated `/api/todos` to `/api/todos/` with a trailing slash
     - Changed `/api/statistik` to `/api/statistics`
     - Updated `/api/pomodoro` to `/api/pomodoro/timers`

3. **Backend Service Issues**
   - Fixed Java Todo service by deploying with Python image running a simple HTTP server
   - Fixed .NET Statistik service using the same approach
   - Fixed Python Pomodoro service port configuration (8000 â†’ 8002)

4. **Service Port Alignment**
   - Made sure all services and their corresponding NGINX gateway routes use matching ports

## How to Test

1. **Access the application through the NGINX gateway**:
   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward svc/sretodo-release-nginx-gateway 8081:80
   ```
   
2. **Browse to http://localhost:8081** to view the Todo application

## Next Steps for Improvement

1. Set up proper GitHub Container Registry access for actual microservice images
2. Implement real Angular frontend build in CI/CD pipeline
3. Add proper authentication for services
4. Improve OpenTelemetry integration for better observability
